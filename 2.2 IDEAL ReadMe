I: in a single linked list of n nodes in length return the Kth to last element
D: after traversal of the linked list i need to return the value in a position k from the last 
  the method will probably contain a linked list traversal paired with a runner ahead of it.
E,A: My solution is to for loop a temporary node pointer k nodes in front of the head.
    once the temp var has reached its position then we can have another temp variable  
    traverse the linked list updating both pointers on each temp. once the runner has reached the end
    we know our other tmp is in the position kth from the end and we can return the value
    
    the time complexity would be O(n)
L: we where able to study this problem in class which helped illuminate the ability of using a "runner" variable
